# Ordered funnel implementation

Use the Python below verbatim inside the isolated procedure. Do not ask a model to reimplement
this fixed algorithm. `funnel_tail(stage_events)` appends CTEs and the final SELECT to a
bounded `WITH e AS (...)`. That e CTE selects only `actor`, `attempt`, `event`, exact `timestamp AS t`,
and boolean `eligible`. Build it from validated configuration: select the configured keys,
use both exact window bounds, allowed event names and the validated exclusions, and retain raw
rows while `eligible` checks the types and nonempty keys. Project UUID validity applies only
when project identity semantics require it; run_id is a nonempty string, not necessarily UUID.
Never hardcode the example project's events, IDs or dates. Actor/attempt identifiers stay inside
PostHog. The output is one aggregate row (the tail ends in `LIMIT 2`, so Tin's HogQL guard sees
an explicit LIMIT and a second row is detected, not hidden); medians average the two middle
observations. The whole query, e CTE included, must stay one SELECT of at most 8000 bytes
without UNION or OFFSET, or Tin refuses it before PostHog sees it.

The algorithm groups by actor AND attempt, uses strict timestamp comparisons and selects one
deepest, earliest chain per actor. Missing array elements cannot advance a stage: length checks
own that decision. Empty input yields zero counts and null medians. Coverage decides whether
zero eligible rows mean no events or missing instrumentation. Two and three steps are supported.
Request limits still apply. Do not run the synthetic cases against the provider in ordinary runs;
those belong to separately authorized qualification. Use local synthetic responses to check the
validator and compare the generated SQL against this resource before dispatch.

Pass the query.hogql result unchanged to `read_funnel(result, len(stage_events))`; it is Tin's
projection `{columns, types, rows, has_more, truncated}`. Keep the columns/rows in evidence and
report the returned stage rows. Also verify the reported types are numeric for these named
columns; reject missing, truncated or malformed data.
An error or inconsistent row is unavailable, never zero. Every required window must pass the ordinary case.
